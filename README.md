# VemBetarLandingPage

This was a project I had to do in a couple of days for the company I work at.
We are a company of digital Marketing and one of our clients is the VemBetar sports betting website.
So, for our client we had to create their Landing Page for newcomers who want to become partners and invite more people to be part of it.

I had a lot of trouble to make this webpage responsive and it still is not completely responsive.
If you guys could improve my code, give me ideas and suggestions, I would appreciate it very much.

Hope it helps, thanks a lot in advance!
